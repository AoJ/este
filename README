What is it?
  It's my beloved development stack. Run one script, to compile Coffeescript,
  Stylus, Soy templates, update deps.js, run insanely fast unit tests, on file
  change (cmd-s). One console output for all these wonderful tools. Tested on
  mac and win.

How to use it
  Install Node.js, Java, Python.
  npm install -g mocha
  npm install -g stylus
  npm install -g coffee-script
  Clone.
  Update submodule to get last Closure Library version.
  Sublimetext install: todo
  type 'node assets/js/dev/start' in console from project root
  start creating something beautiful

Scripts
  node assets/js/dev/start
    - will start simple server
    - watch and compile stylus files
    - watch and compile soy templates
    - watch and compile coffee files
      - then updates deps.js
      - then run tests

  node assets/js/dev/build app
    - will compile app
    - --one, --html, --stage options (todo)

Ok. I got it, what's next?
  Take a look at the app. It does almost nothing. But TodoMVC is in process.
  In the meantime, you can see what este.mvc namespace contains yet.
  Namespaces in assets/js, app is obvious, dev is development scripts, este
  is my personal everything-i-consider-as-reusable library. You or your company
  should have your own shared-wisdom-persisted library.

Near future

  TodoMVC mobile version.
